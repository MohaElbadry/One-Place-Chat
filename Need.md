## tools
 - The tool generator creates executable MCP tools based on the semantic understanding. This involves generating code that can accept natural language input, extract parameters, validate data, and make API calls. The generated tools need to be as intelligent as hand-crafted ones, handling edge cases and providing helpful error messages.
   - The tool generator should be able to create tools that can:
   - Accept natural language input.
   - Extract parameters from the input.
   - Validate the data.
   - Make API calls to external services.
