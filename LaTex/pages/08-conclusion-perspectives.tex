This internship project at Zenika has been a transformative journey in understanding how artificial intelligence can revolutionize the way humans interact with technology. One Place Chat represents a significant step forward in making API interactions accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.\\\\


The technical achievements of this project include the development of a three-stage tool management pipeline, the integration of OpenAI embeddings for intelligent tool discovery, and the creation of a user-friendly interface built with modern web technologies. These components work together seamlessly to deliver a chat experience where users can interact with any API simply by describing what they want in natural language.\\\\


We extend our sincere gratitude to our supervisors and the entire Zenika team for their guidance, support, and expertise throughout this project. Their mentorship has been instrumental in transforming theoretical concepts into a functional, innovative solution.\\\\

In conclusion, One Place Chat demonstrates that AI-powered interfaces can democratize access to complex technical systems. This project marks not only the completion of an internship but also the beginning of a broader vision for intelligent, conversational software that serves users of all technical levels.
